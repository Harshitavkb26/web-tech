            “You can have data without information, but
             you cannot have information without data.” —
              Daniel Keys Moran<br>

As we move further into the information age, we are finding
 ourselves in an increasingly data-rich and data-oriented world.
  Almost everything that a company does today is dictated by 
  data and analytics in one way or another.<br> Organizations have
   begun using sophisticated analytics techniques to identify 
   new growth areas, streamline costs, increase operating margins
   , make better human resource decisions and devise more effective
    budgets. The influence of data also spills over into our personal
     lives, health care, the environment and much more.
