               <h1>Machine learning</h1>
               <h3>Machine Learning (ML) is an application of Artificial intelligence that provides 
                   systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without 
                   being explicitly programmed.ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one
                    would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer
                     that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is 
                     actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.
                      Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple 
                      layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input.
                       Application of machine learning includeVirtual Personal Assistants,Predictions
                        while Commuting, Videos Surveillance, Face Recognition,Online Fraud Detection
                        ,Be part of this thrilling workshop to know about this interesting development
                         in the world of technology!</h3>

               <h3>Ethical Hacking, also called Penetration Testing is a cybersecurity act which refers
                    to intruding/penetrating into system or networks to find out threats or vulnerabilities
                     in those systems which a malicious attacker may find and exploit causing loss of data,
                      financial loss or other major damages.

                The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of the network or systems by fixing
                 the vulnerabilities found during testing. Ethical hackers may use the same methods and tools 
                 used by malicious hackers but with the permission of the authorized person for the purpose of 
                 improving the security and defending the systems from attacks by malicious users.
                
                Techkriti invites you to be a part of a workshop to manoeuvre towards your first steps in the
                
                world of Ethical Hacking!</h3>

               <h1>Cloud computing</h1>
               <h3>Cloud computing is the use of various services, such as software development platforms,
                    servers, storage and software, over the internet, often referred to as the "cloud." 
                    The cloud may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds), or be available
                     to many organizations (public cloud).The availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost
                      computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization,
                       service-oriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in
                        cloud computing.

                The goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies,
                 without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The cloud aims to cut costs,
                  and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles.</h3>
