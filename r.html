            <h2>Intro</h2>
            The ultimate test of engineering excellence, teamwork, 
            strategy, and gaming is here! Techtantra brings to you its flagship event
            , Robowars. Witness the brightest engineers in India build the mightiest
             monsters which shall unleash Armageddon on the battle turf!<br>
            Each team has to come up with a wirelessly controlled robot capable of a 
            one on one and trio combat. With pneumatic pincers, mighty armors, nifty
             axes and more innovative weapons, these merciless mercenaries shall fight 
             for the glory of their makers, upholders of the dignity of their institutions.
              The law of the jungle, of 'might is right,' shall prevail. Only the toughest
               shall survive! Sparks shall fly, and temperatures shall soar high this
                Techtantraâ€™20! Be there to witness the raw aggression, the crude violence 
                of these mean machines as they rip each other apart!
